# Railway-specific environment variables
# For persistent file storage on Railway, use these configurations

# Option 1: Use Railway Volumes (requires manual dashboard setup)
# The app already supports this via railway.toml

# Option 2: For immediate fix without volumes
# Upload files to public/tmp instead (temporary)
# They will persist for the session but be cleaned up on restart

# Option 3: Use external storage (recommended for production)
# Set up AWS S3 or similar service
